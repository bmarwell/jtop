= jtop
:toc: macro

*jtop* is an experimental, interactive process viewer, just like the awesome https://htop.dev[htop].
Unlike htop, *jtop* is written in pure Java (who would have guessedâ€¦) and makes use of the new https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/core/foreign-function-and-memory-api.html[Java 22 Foreign Function & Memory API], where needed.

It will never be as feature-complete as htop, of course.
This is just a showcase of what you can do with Java 22.

== Compiling and running

To compile, all you need is Java 22 or later on your system.
Point the environment variable `JAVA_HOME` to it.
For example, when using sdkman, just install java by executing:

[source,bash]
----
sdk install java 22.0.1-tem
sdk use java 22.0.1-tem
----

Then run the build with tests:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw verify
----

The app can then be executed like so:

[source.bash]
----
./app/target/jreleaser/assemble/jtop/java-archive/work/*/bin/jtop
----
